# To Do:

Copy navbar, hero layout from watchdesign or other sites I've built. Include hamburger for mobile.
Set up Web3Forms for contact form.

Plan what containers, components etc we're going to use to style the site.
Make sure site is ssg or ssr, or the only use csr when necessary (ie for the form?)

# Notes

- Should make each component a page sized block. Like, the components are stacked one on top of the other.

* Have to figure out a way to scroll down the page when a button is pressed, ie for the contact us and View All Services buttons.
